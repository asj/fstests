List of reviewers, co-maintainers and how to submit fstests changes
====================================================

Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
easier on the maintainers.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

Tips for patch submitters
-------------------------

1.	Always *test* your changes, however small, on at least 4 or
	5 people, preferably many more.

2.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple
	configurations. In particular check that changes don't break
	fstests basic running.

3.	When you are happy with a change make it generally available for
	testing and await feedback.

4.	Make a patch available to fstests@ list directly, that's the only
	one mailing list which maintain the whole fstests project.

	PLEASE CC: the relevant reviewers, co-maintainers and mailing lists
	that are generated by ``tools/get_maintainer.pl.``

	PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the
	patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes
	it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.

	PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything
	or does something very odd once a month document it.

5.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
	do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch
	not you.

6.	Happy hacking.

Descriptions of section entries and preferred order
---------------------------------------------------

	M: *Mail* patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	   These people might be a co-maintainer (with Supported status) or
	   maintainer (with Maintained status).
	R: Designated *Reviewer*: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
	L: Besides fstests@ list itself, this *Mailing list* is relevant to
	   this area, should be CCed.
	S: *Status*, one of the following (note: all things are maintained by
	   fstests@vger.kernel.org):
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it, has the privilege to
			merge & push.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	W: *Web-page* with status/info
	Q: *Patchwork* web based patch tracking system site
	B: URI for where to file *bugs*. A web-page with detailed bug
	   filing info, a direct bug tracker link, or a mailto: URI.
	C: URI for *chat* protocol, server and channel where developers
	   usually hang out, for example irc://server/channel.
	P: Subsystem Profile document for more details submitting
	   patches to the given subsystem. This is either an in-tree file,
	   or a URI.
	T: *SCM* tree type and location.
	   Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit, topgit
	F: *Files* and directories wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	tests/xfs/	all files in and below tests/xfs
	   F:	tests/generic/*	all files in tests/generic, but not below
	   F:	*/ext4/*	all files in "any top level directory"/ext4
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: *Excluded* files and directories that are NOT maintained, same
	   rules as F:. Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	src/
	   X:	src/vfs
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	N: Files and directories *Regex* patterns.
	   N:	[^a-z]tegra	all files whose path contains tegra
	                        (not including files like integrator)
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple N: lines acceptable.
	   tools/get_maintainer.pl has different behavior for files that
	   match F: pattern and matches of N: patterns.  By default,
	   get_maintainer will not look at git log history when an F: pattern
	   match occurs.  When an N: match occurs, git log history is used
	   to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.
	K: *Content regex* (perl extended) pattern match in a patch or file.
	   For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.

Maintainers List
----------------

.. note:: The whole fstests are maintained by fstests@vger.kernel.org, so you
	  should send patch to fstests@ at least. Other relevant mailing list
	  or reviewer or co-maintainer can be in cc list.
